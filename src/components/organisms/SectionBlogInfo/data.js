  text: 'Transdermal patches continue to grow in popularity as manufacturers find new ways to develop all-natural, topical ingredients that self-activate; allowing users to receive treatment in an adhesive. The benefit to delivering vitamins, herbs and supplements through the skin is that there are fewer side-effects and allows for easy removal of the patch in the case that there is an adverse reaction. Patch Export, LLC is one of the leading manufacturers in bulk, wholesale topical and transdermal skin contact patches. At Patch Export, we saw the need and demand of consumers seeking a product that would not interfere with their busy schedule but that would provide them relief throughout the day. We saw the gap in the market: companyâ€™s searching for a wholesale manufacturer of all-natural, transdermal patches. With that, we developed the opportunity for companies to use their own private branding to package and market these patches.',
